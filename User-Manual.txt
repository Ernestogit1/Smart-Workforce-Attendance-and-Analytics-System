Project overview

    Two web apps: Admin portal (management + analytics) and Employee portal (self‑service).
    Backend: Django REST API with Firebase Admin auth and Cloudinary for media.
    Core domains: attendance, employees, leaves, analytics.
1. System requirements
    Browser: Latest Chrome/Edge/Firefox.
    Node.js 18+ for Admin/Employee apps.
    Python 3.10+ for server; pip; virtualenv.
    Internet access for Firebase/Cloudinary endpoints.
2. Getting started
    Automatic setup Admin Account it will be save in the mongoDB if admin is not yet in the mongodb and Firebase
        Admin Account: 
            - email: admin@gmail.com 
            - password: admin123
    Obtain an admin account from IT.
    URLs are defined by your deployment; local defaults:
            - Admin: http://localhost:5173
            - Employee: http://localhost:5174 
            - API: http://127.0.0.1:8000
    Configure environment files in each app from .env.example.

8. Setup and running (local)
    Backend (server)
    Put the outside of the backend folder
        =================================================================
        # Windows PowerShell
        cd server/backend
        python -m venv .venv
        . .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
        pip install -r ../requirements.txt
        # Set environment values from server/.env.example → server/.env
        python manage.py migrate
        python manage.py runserver
        =================================================================
    Admin app
        =================================================================
        cd admin
        npm install
        # Set VITE_API_URL and other keys from admin/.env.example → .env
        npm run dev
        =================================================================
    Employee app
        =================================================================
        cd employee
        npm install
        # Set VITE_API_URL and other keys from employee/.env.example → .env
        npm run dev
        =================================================================
9.Environment configuration (high level)
    Admin/Employee (.env)
        VITE_API_URL: base URL of Django API.
        Firebase public keys if used on client.
    Server (.env)
        DB settings (if using external DB), Cloudinary credentials, Firebase admin key path, JWT secret, CORS origins.
10.Troubleshooting
    Exported PDF is blank or clipped
        Ensure the dashboard content is within the export container; try enlarging browser window. Remote images require CORS; enable useCORS in exporter (already configured).
    Buttons appear in PDF
        They are tagged with class/data no‑pdf and ignored by html2canvas; clear cache and retry if you still see them.
    Table looks cramped
        Widen the browser or use the horizontal scrollbar; min widths are enforced to avoid truncation.
    Login fails
        Verify credentials and server availability; check CORS and .env API URL.
    Photos not loading
        Confirm Cloudinary credentials and that URLs are public.
11. Data privacy and security
    Role‑based access control enforced in backend routes and client guards.
    Admin actions are restricted; employees can only access their own data.
    Use HTTPS in production; keep secrets out of client .env.
12.Support workflow
    Capture steps to reproduce, screenshots, and console/network logs.
    Provide app (Admin/Employee) and page, timestamp, and user email to IT.
